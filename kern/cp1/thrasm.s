# struct thread * _thread_swtch(struct thread * resuming_thread)

# Switches from the currently running thread to another thread and returns when
# the current thread is scheduled to run again. Argument /resuming_thread/ is
# the thread to be resumed. Returns a pointer to the previously-scheduled
# thread. This function is called in thread.c. The spelling of swtch is
# historic.
