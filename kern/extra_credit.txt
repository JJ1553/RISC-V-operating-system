Running Extra Credit Tests:

In kernel:
make clean
make test.memory
make run-test-memory

At this point you will see "vptr length valid!" and "String valid!"

Now enter "main_test_memory.c" in kern and change two lines:
-Line 50, change "PAGE_SIZE*5" to "PAGE_SIZE*6". This will cause the checked vptr to be invalid
-Comment out line 65. This will remove the null terminator at the end of the string and make it invalid

Run the commands again to run kernel and you will see both are invalid (or do one at a time)
